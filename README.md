# OnionRoutingSimulator
Hi!

Ever wondered what onion routing is or how it works? Onion routing is a protocol/technique that allows for anonymoous transfer of messages between computers over a network.

The node that is transfering the message does not know where it orginally came from. although it can calculate the next node and pass on the message using hashing. Hashing algorithm tells the detsiinatin node whether the message is meeant for them.

This simulator takes in an input file of 20 simulation nodes in the network and tries to pass messages between them anonymously.

The project was written in Java and contains some Junit test files to ensure the respective methods implemented give the required result using input output mapping.
